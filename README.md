# 🚀 Real-Time Collaborative Canvas

This is a multi-user, real-time drawing application built for the FLAM technical assignment. It allows multiple users to draw on a single shared canvas and see each other's actions, including live cursors, as they happen.

The core of the application is built on a server-side "Operation Log" to ensure perfect state synchronization, conflict resolution, and global undo/redo capabilities.

## ✨ Features

* **Real-Time Drawing:** All operations are broadcast to all clients instantly.
* **Single Shared Canvas:** All users draw on the same canvas.
* **Global Undo/Redo:** A server-side history log allows any user to undo or redo the *entire canvas's* last action.
* **Live Cursors:** See other users' cursors move across the canvas in real-time.
* **Online User List:** A live-updating sidebar shows who is currently connected.
* **Drawing Tools:** Includes a brush, eraser, color picker, and stroke width adjuster.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5 Canvas, CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express
* **Real-Time:** Socket.io
